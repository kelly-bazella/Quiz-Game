# Quiz-Game

This is a functional quiz game built with Javascript. The user clicks start and the timer immediately starts counting down, if they get the question right they are presented with the next question. If the user answers incorrectly, 10 "points" or seconds is taken off their score. If they get through all the questions they are taken to a screen that gives them their score where they can enter their initials and be added to the highscore list.
